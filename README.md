## Description

Stay organized with Notetaker! The app that makes keeping track of notes quick and easy!

The motivation behind this project was to create an app that allows you to easily keep track of your plans in one easy to use, centralized location.

By completing this project I was able to demonstrate my knowledge of the core principals of express.js that we learned in coding class and put them to use.
